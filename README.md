# Additional HTML-related Functions for [`rtfeldman/elm-css`](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css)

[![html-styled-extra Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/matken11235/html-styled-extra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/matken11235/html-styled-extra)

This package contains convenience functions for working with Html, beyond that
which `rtfeldman/elm-css` provides.

You may want to import this into the `Html` namespace:

```elm
import Html.Styled.Extra as Html
```

Then you can do things like writing `Html.Styled.nothing` instead of `text ""`.

There are many event handlers & decoders in `Html.Styled.Events.Extra`, such as
`targetValueInt` or `onClickPreventDefault`.


Feedback and contributions are very welcome.
